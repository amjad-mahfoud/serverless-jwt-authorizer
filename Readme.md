# Serverless functions with custom JWT authorizer

This example demonstrates how to implement a custom JWT based authorizer to protect your serverless APIs on AWS Lambda.

DynamoDB is used as a data store to persist user records.

Each file in [./functions/](https://github.com/tmaximini/serverless-jwt-authorizer/tree/master/functions) is a seperate lambda api endpoint.
Check `serverless.yml` for configuration.
